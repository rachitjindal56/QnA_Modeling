This combination of cancellations and σ and π overlaps results in dioxygen’s double bond character and reactivity, and a triplet electronic 
ground state. An electron configuration with two unpaired electrons as found in dioxygen (see the filled π* orbitals in the diagram), 
orbitals that are of equal energy—i.e., degenerate—is a configuration termed a spin triplet state. Hence, the ground state of the O2 
molecule is referred to as triplet oxygen.[b] The highest energy, partially filled orbitals are antibonding, and so their filling weakens 
the bond order from three to two. Because of its unpaired electrons, triplet oxygen reacts only slowly with most organic molecules, which 
have paired electron spins; this prevents spontaneous combustion.

Between 1991 and 2000, the total area of forest lost in the Amazon rose from 415,000 to 587,000 square kilometres (160,000 to 227,000 sq mi), 
with most of the lost forest becoming pasture for cattle. Seventy percent of formerly forested land in the Amazon, and 91% of land deforested 
since 1970, is used for livestock pasture. Currently, Brazil is the second-largest global producer of soybeans after the United States. 
New research however, conducted by Leydimere Oliveira et al., has shown that the more rainforest is logged in the Amazon, the less 
precipitation reaches the area and so the lower the yield per hectare becomes. So despite the popular perception, there has been no 
economical advantage for Brazil from logging rainforest zones and converting these to pastoral fields."""]
